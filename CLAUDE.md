## Commands

```bash
npm run dev       # start dev server
npm run build     # production build
npm run lint      # eslint
```

## Architecture

**This is a personal portfolio site** — not a multi-page app with shared state. Pages are mostly independent. The Works section links *out* to separately deployed scaffold projects; nothing is embedded here.

**Two distinct pages:**
- `/` — Homepage (bento grid, plan-6 design). Professional face: showcases work, skills, CTAs.
- `/about` — Personal page for TikTok funnel traffic. Separate vibe from homepage — personal, not business.

**Homepage design:** `plans/plan-6.md` is the spec. Pre-built components live in the `landing-page` repo at `components/plan-6/` and `app/plan-6/`. When copying them here, all paths must be under `src/` — the `@/` alias maps to `./src/`, not the project root.

**shadcn style is `radix-nova`** — not the standard `default` or `new-york`. Don't run `shadcn init` again; it will overwrite the style. Add components with `npx shadcn@latest add <component>` only.

**Tailwind 4** — no `tailwind.config.js`. All CSS custom properties and theme overrides go in `src/app/globals.css`. The plan-6 design tokens (e.g. `--accent: #a3b899` sage green) belong there too.

## Learned

### Context
- `@/` alias resolves to `./src/` — all feature code goes under `src/app/`, `src/components/`, `src/lib/`. Stray `components/` or `lib/` directories at the project root are artifacts from a bad copy attempt and should be deleted.
- `landing-page` repo (`C:/Users/MSI/Documents/GitHub/landing-page`) is where design variants were explored. Plan-6 won. Its files are the source of truth for the homepage build.
- The pre-built plan-6 source imports from `@/lib/placeholder-vi` — that module holds typed mock data (`works`, `testimonials`, `owner`). It needs to live at `src/lib/placeholder-vi.ts`.
- shadcn components are already extensively installed (full suite in `src/components/ui/`). Check there before adding new ones.
- `src/app/globals.css` is the only stylesheet entry point. Plan-scoped CSS (like `plan6.css` from the landing-page repo) should either be inlined there or imported from the page file.
- `next-themes`, `framer-motion`, and `@faker-js/faker` are already installed.
